		<p>If you need to call us about a debt you can't pay in full or on time, or want to set up an arrangement to make smaller payments over time, refer to: <a href="payment-arrangements.html">Arrange to pay your debt over time</a></p>

		<h2 id="interest">Interest and penalties you could be charged</h2>
		<p>We charge interest on most unpaid balances owing. In some cases, there might also be penalties associated with filing a late return or missing a payment deadline.</p>
		<p><a href="interest-penalties.html">Interest and penalties on late or incorrect payments</a></p>
		
		<h2 id="offsets">Offsets from refunds or other government payments</h2>
		<p>We apply tax refunds and government credit or benefit payments you should receive (such as the GST/HST credit) to your balance owing.</p>
		<p><a href="debt-collections/offsets.html">How we automatically apply credits and refunds to your debt</a></p>
		
		<h2 id="notify">How we will notify you when we begin taking action</h2>
		<p>If you have a debt and haven't confirmed arrangements to pay it, or if you don't make your scheduled payments on time, we may begin legal actions.</p>
		
		<p>Before we start legal actions, we will generally:
		<ul>
			<li>make up to <strong>3</strong> attempts to give you a <strong>verbal</strong> legal warning by phone</li>
			<li>send <strong>1 written</strong> legal warning letter</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<p>However, if your business owes a <strong>payroll or GST/HST remittance debt</strong>, we may begin legal actions right after you are notified of your debt.</p>

	      			<p>In some situations, we may decide there is a risk of not collecting all or part of your tax or COVID-19 business subsidy debt while it is still under collections restrictions. We can apply to the Federal Court or the superior court of a province for a <strong>jeopardy order</strong>. This allows the CRA to take immediate legal actions to collect the debt.</p>
	      <p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/collection-tax-debts-jeopardy.html">Collection of tax debts in jeopardy</a></p>
				
		<details>
			<summary>Business debts and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</summary>	
			<p id="corporate-actions">For <strong>GST/HST remittance and payroll deduction debts</strong>, the notice of assessment or reassessment is considered the written legal warning for amounts owing. Once a verbal legal warning is attempted, the CRA can proceed with legal actions. The CRA can continue to collect amounts assessed on corporate accounts even if you filed an objection or an appeal to the Tax Court. </p>
			<p>If you are a <strong>large corporation</strong>, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and have filed an objection or an appeal, the CRA can start collecting 50% of your assessed income tax owing right away.</p>
			<p>For <strong>corporate tax, GST/HST remittance, payroll, and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</strong>, <a href="setoffs">set-offs</a> can be issued as soon as a notice of determination/assessment has been sent.</p>
		</details>
		
		<h3>Make sure it's really the CRA contacting you</h3>
		<span id="make-sure-CRA"><p>If you receive a call about a CRA balance owing or a debt collected by the CRA that you never saw on a Notice of Assessment, Notice of Reassessment, Notice of Determination, notice of Debt, or another notice:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud/expect-cra-contacts.html#toc0">verify the caller is really a CRA employee</a></li>

		<h2 id="actions">Legal actions we may take</h2>
		<p>Depending on your situation, there are different legal actions the CRA might take.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="debt-collections/garnishing.html">Garnishing your income and accounts</a></li>
			<li><a href="debt-collections/co-liability.html">Making another person or entity also responsible for your debt</a></li>
