		<h2 id="arrangement">Make a payment arrangement to pay over time</h2>
		<p>If you have a debt you cannot pay on time, make an arrangement to pay your debt in smaller payments over time.</p>
		<p>Even if interest will still be applied to late payments, we will not take legal actions if there's a payment arrangement in place.</p>
		<p><a href="payment-arrangements.html">Arrange to pay over time</a></p>
		
		<h2 id="reduce">Reduce the amount you owe</h2>
		<p>In extraordinary circumstances, there might even be options to help you reduce the amount you owe, such as by cancelling interest or penalties if you were severely affected by a natural disaster or financial hardship, relief for student loans or customs debt, or bankruptcy.</p>
		<p><a href="">Reduce the amount you owe</a></p>
		
		<h3-->
		
		<h2 id="interest">Interest and penalties you could be charged</h2>
		<p>The CRA charges interest on unpaid balances owing. In some cases, there might also be penalties associated with missing a payment deadline.</p>
		<p><a href="interest-penalties.html">Interest and penalties on late or incorrect payments</a></p>
		
		<h2 id="offsets">Offsets from benefits or other government payments</h2>
		<p>If you have a balance owing, we may automatically apply tax refunds and government credit or benefit payments you are entitled to (such as the GST/HST credit) to your tax and other government debts.</p>
		<p><a href="debt-collections/offsets.html">How we automatically apply credits and refunds to your debt</a></p>
		
		<h2 id="notify">How we will notify you when we begin taking action</h2>
		<p>If you have a debt and have not contacted us to make arrangements to pay it, or if you do not make your scheduled payments, we may begin legal collections actions.</p>
		
		<p>If you owe a debt with the CRA for more than 90 days after we notify you, CRA collections will generally:
		<ul>
			<li>make up to <strong>3</strong> attempts to give you a verbal legal warning by phone</li>
			<li>send <strong>1</strong> written legal warning letter</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<p>However, if your business owes a <strong>payroll or GST/HST remittance debt</strong>, in some cases we may begin collections actions right after you are notified of your debt.</p>
				
		<details>
			<summary>Business debts and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</summary>	
			<p id="corporate-actions">For <strong>GST/HST remittance and payroll deduction debts</strong>, the notice of assessment or reassessment is considered the written legal warning for amounts owing. Once a verbal legal warning is attempted, the CRA can proceed with collections actions. The CRA can continue to collect amounts assessed on corporate accounts even if you filed an objection or an appeal to the Tax Court. </p>
			<p>If you are a <strong>large corporation</strong>, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and have filed an objection or an appeal, the CRA can start collecting 50% of your assessed income tax owing right away.</p>
			<p>For <strong>corporate tax, GST/HST remittance, payroll, and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</strong>, <a href="setoffs">set-offs</a> can be issued as soon as a notice of determination/assessment has been sent.</p>
			<p>If we determine there is a risk of not collecting all or part of your assessed corporate income tax or COVID-19 business subsidy overpayment debt while you are under collection restrictions, we can apply to the Federal Court or the superior court of a province for a <strong>jeopardy order</strong>. This allows the CRA to secure any assets that you own and to take immediate action to collect the debt.</p>

		<h3>Make sure it's really the CRA contacting you</h3>
		<span id="make-sure-CRA"><p>If you receive a call about a CRA balance owing that you never saw on a Notice of Assessment, Notice of Reassessment, or Notice of Determination:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud/expect-cra-contacts.html#toc0">verify the caller is really a CRA employee</a></li>

		<h2 id="actions">Legal collection actions we may take</h2>
		<p>Depending on your situation, there are different legal actions the CRA might take.</p>

			<li><a href="debt-collections/co-liability.html">Making another person or entity co-liable for your debt</a></li>
