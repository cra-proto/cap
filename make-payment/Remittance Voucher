         <p>Most remittance vouchers need to be ordered by through My Account, My Business account, or Represent a client, or by calling the CRA. They cannot be printed at home because they are produced using magnetic ink, and financial institutions will not accept photocopies. Ordered forms usually come personalized, meaning they will be pre-populated with some of your information.</p>
		 <p>Some remittance vouchers used by <strong>individuals</strong> may be downloaded and printed at home for payments at financial institutions, Canada Post retail outlets, or by mail.</p>
		 <p> The vouchers are:</p>
		 <ul>
			<li>INNS3, Instalment Remittance Voucher - <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/inns3.html">Download</a></li>
			<li>T7DR, Amount owing Remittance Voucher - <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t7dr.html">Download</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once an order is placed, online or by phone, it takes approximately <strong>5 to 10 business days</strong> for you to receive it by mail.</p>
