		<h2 id="how-much">Calculating typical corporate income tax instalments (federal and provincial)</h2>
<p>There are <strong>three steps</strong> you must take to calculate your instalment payments:</p>
		<ol class="lst-stps">
			<li>Estimate your amounts for the current year</li>
<li>Choose if you'll be making monthly or quarterly payments</li>
<li>Calculate the amount of each payment based on 3 options</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Most corporations will include the following taxes in this instalment calculation:</p>
		<ul>
					<li>Income tax (Part <abbr title="one">I</abbr> tax)</li>
					<li>Tax on capital of financial institutions (Part <abbr title="six">VI</abbr> tax)</li>
					<li>Tax on dividends on taxable preferred shares(Part <abbr title="six point one">VI.1</abbr> tax)</li>
					<li>Additional tax on authorized foreign banks (Part <abbr title="thirteen point one">XIII.1</abbr> tax)</li>
			<li>The tax you have to pay to provinces and territories, <strong>other than</strong> Quebec and Alberta</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Corporations that earned taxable income in Quebec or Alberta pay provincial tax directly to those provinces.</p>
		<p>There are separate steps to <a href="#how-much-2">calculate tax on carved-out income or investment income of life insurers</a>.

<h3>Step 1: Estimate your amounts for the current year</h3>
			<p>The first step when calculating your instalments is to estimate your total taxes and credits for the current year.</p>
				
<p>Worksheet 1 is used to calculate these estimated amounts.</p>
		<p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2ws1.html">Worksheet 1 - Calculating your estimated tax payable and tax credits for 2023 (T2WS1)</a></p>

		<p><strong>Estimated tax payable for 2023</strong></p>
<h6><strong>Amount A – Estimated taxable income for 2023</strong></h6>
<p>Enter the amount of taxable income you're estimating for your 2023 tax year.</p>
<h6><strong>Estimated 2023 federal tax on income (amounts 1 to 4)</strong></h6>

<p>However, the $500,000 dividend allowance is reduced if you paid more than <span class="nowrap">$1 million</span> of dividends on taxable preferred shares in the previous year.</p>

The lower rate applies to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the income eligible for the federal small business deduction</li>
<li>the income based on limits established by the particular province or territory</li>
</ul>
<p>The higher rate applies to all other income. Various deductions, credits, and tax relief may affect the rates. This amount is your provincial and territorial tax payable (<abbr title="Part 1">Part I</abbr> tax and any other applicable tax, including capital taxes) net of provincial and territorial non-refundable credits.</p>

	<p>Should a corporation no longer be eligible for quarterly instalments, it will need to start making monthly instalments starting the month after the next quarterly instalment payment is due.</p>
<p>Here is the formula to calculate remaining monthly instalment payments:</p>
<p>The estimated tax payable for the current year, <strong>minus </strong>the total of all instalment payments due quarterly while eligible, <strong>divided by</strong> the number of months remaining in the tax year.</p>

        <p>Corporation B has a December 31 year-end and an estimated tax payable for the current year: $120,000</p>
<p><strong>Divided</strong> by 4</p>
<p>Quarterly instalment payments: $30,000</p>
<p>Corporation B ceases to be compliant on May 31, 2023. It is allowed to pay its next instalment due at the end of the current quarter, which is June 30, 2023. Corporation B will have to begin to pay monthly instalments starting on <span class="nowrap">July 31, 2023</span>.</p>
<p>The first two instalment payments of $30,000 are due quarterly on <span class="nowrap">March 31</span> and <span class="nowrap">June 30, 2023</span>.</p>
<p>The number of months remaining in the tax year after June 30, 2023 is six.</p>
<p>Once again, the formula to calculate remaining monthly instalment payments:</p>
<p>Estimated tax payable for the current year <strong>minus</strong> the total of all instalment payments due quarterly while eligible, <strong>divided</strong> by the number of months remaining in the tax year.</p>
<p>[$120,000 – ($30,000 x 2)] ÷ 6 = $10,000</p>
<p>Therefore, six monthly instalment payments of $10,000 are due on <span class="nowrap">July 31</span>, <span class="nowrap">August 31</span>, <span class="nowrap">September 30</span>, <span class="nowrap">October 31</span>, <span class="nowrap">November 30</span>, and <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2023</span>.</p>

		<h2 id="interest">Interest and penalties</h2>

		<p>We will assess your return and calculate any interest using the instalment calculation option that results in the least amount payable by instalments. If you use calculation option 1, we will not charge interest as long as you paid on time and your estimated tax was <strong>higher</strong> than <strong>both</strong>:
			<ul>
				<li>the year's actual tax</li>
			<li>the tax calculated using option 2 or 3</li>
			</ul>
		<p>We will charge <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-payments/understanding-interest.html#nstlmnt">instalment interest</a> if you make late or insufficient instalment payments.</p>
		<p>When instalment interest is more than&nbsp;$1,000, we may charge an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-payments/avoiding-penalties.html#nstlmnt">instalment&nbsp;penalty</a>.</p>
			
<h3>Overpaying or paying early to offset late or underpaid instalments</h3>
			<p>We calculate credit interest using the offset method when you overpay your instalments or pay them early. This means you can reduce or eliminate the interest charged on late or insufficient instalment payments by prepaying or overpaying your instalments during the same tax year.</P>

<p>We <strong>do not refund any instalment interest</strong> calculated using the offset method. It is used only when calculating instalment interest charges.</p>

<p>The interest rate on overpayments is lower than on underpayments. However, when we calculate instalment interest using the offset method, the interest rate is the same on prepayments and overpayments as it is on underpayments.</p>
