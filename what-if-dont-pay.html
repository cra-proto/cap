<h2 id="actions">Legal actions we may take to collect your debt</h2>   
	    <p>If you do not call us or make a payment arrangement, we may take legal action to collect certain balances you owe. [Consider a friendlier intro.]</p>
<p>If you owe an individual tax or benefit debt, we will make several attempts to <a href="#contact">notify you verbally and in writing</a> before we begin collections actions.</p>
	    <details>
	<summary>Corporate debts and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</summary>
	    
<p id="corporate-actions">For <strong>corporations</strong>, the notice of assessment or reassessment is considered the written legal warning for goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and payroll deduction amounts owing. Once a verbal legal warning is attempted, the CRA can proceed with collections actions. The CRA can continue to collect amounts assessed on corporate accounts even if you filed an objection or an appeal to the Tax Court. </p>
	    <p>If you are a <strong>large corporation</strong>, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and have filed an objection or an appeal, the CRA can start collecting 50% of your assessed income tax owing right away.</p>
	    <p>For <strong>corporate tax, GST/HST remittance, payroll, and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</strong>, <a href="setoffs">set-offs</a> can be issued as soon as a notice of determination/assessment has been sent.</p>
		    <p>If we determine there is a risk of not collecting all or part of your assessed corporate income tax or COVID-19 business subsidy overpayment debt while you are under collection restrictions, we can apply to the Federal Court or the superior court of a province for a <strong>jeopardy order</strong>. This allows the CRA to secure any assets that you own and to take immediate action to collect the debt.</p>
</details>
	    <p><mark>How can we best organize this section so it answers the question "what are all the things the CRA can do to collect my debt?"</mark></p>

<h3>Garnishing wages or other income</h3>
	    <p>[plain text explaining what this means.]</p>
		    <p><mark>How is garnishing different than third-party assessments? Sometimes these are separate, sometimes together on the existing pages--does it make sense for these sections to be merged?</mark></p>

	    <p>In some cases, the CRA can legally ask a third party to pay your CRA debt. A third party is often your employer or a financial institution, but can also include a spouse, business partner, director, an individual or a corporation that owes you money or holds money for you. These legal requests are sent to third parties from the CRA [by mail?] as a requirement to pay (RTP) or demand on third party (DTP).
		    <p>Enhanced requirements to pay (ERTPs) are used to collect <strong>payroll deductions and GST/HST debts</strong> (trust fund amounts). This gives the CRA priority over the interests of secured creditors for these types of debts.</p>
		   <p></p> [If we issue a requirement to pay or demand on third party related to a debt you owe, you will receive a copy.]</p>
<p>The amount requested is typically set at 30% of your take home pay and 100% of the funds held in your financial institution. The CRA will apply these funds to your debt.</p>

	    <h3>Asset liens and seizures</h3>
	    <p>[plain text explaining what this means.]</p>
	    <p>The CRA can get a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court confirming the amount you owe. This will make your debt a matter of public record and allow the CRA to place a lien on or seize your assets. The CRA will usually send you a letter to advise you that if you do not resolve your account, we may take further legal action to pay the debt.</p>
