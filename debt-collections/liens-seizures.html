	</div>

		<p>When you have a debt you have not paid, we may use your personal or business assets to secure or pay your debt.</p>
<p>Your personal or business assets can include, but are not limited to, your: 
	<ul>
		<li>personal residence</li>
<li>car</li>
<li>boat</li>
<li>artwork</li>
<li>cottage</li>
<li>rental property</li>
<li>business equipment</li>
</ul></p>

	    
<p>We may:
			<ul>
				<li>place a lien on your assets to secure your debt</li>
				<li>seize and sell your assets to pay your debt</li>
			</ul></p>

	    <details>
		    <summary>What it means when we secure a debt</summary>
<p>When we secure a debt, it means we put a lien or charge against property owned by a taxpayer to protect the government’s interest until the debt is paid in full.</p>
		    <p>A <strong>lien</strong> is a legal claim that we put against a property to secure the payment of a debt. We can seize or force a sale of the property to pay the debt, if the individual or business doesn’t make payments. In most cases, we will remove the lien when the debt is paid.</p>
	    </details>
	    
	    <p>Before we can place a lien on or seize your assets, we must legally certify the amount you owe by getting a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court. This makes your debt a matter of public record.</p>
	    <p>We usually send you a letter to let you know that we have certified your debt in Federal Court. The letter tells you that if you do not fully pay your account, we may take further legal action to pay your debt. In some cases, such as when debts are at risk of not being collected (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/collection-tax-debts-jeopardy.html">in jeopardy</a>), we may tell you verbally that we have certified your debt in Federal Court.</p>

<details><summary>Registering a lien on your assets</summary>
	    <p>Once your debt is certified, we can register a lien against your assets and property. Registering a lien will secure the amount of debt you owe to us. This establishes our priority as a creditor when an asset is sold. It means your debt will be automatically paid with the funds from the sale, before you receive any proceeds.</p>
	<h4>Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) liens at the border</h4>
	<p>Once your customs debt is legally certified, we may:</p>
<ul>
<li>suspend your importation privileges</li>
<li>apply a lien against goods imported by you</li>
<li>apply a lien against goods reported for exportation by you</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>
	    <details><summary>Seizing and selling your assets</summary>
	    <p>If your legally certified debt is still unpaid, we may get a <a title="writ or memorial" class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#inline_content_modal">writ or memorial</a>. This would allow us to seize and sell your assets and property.</p>
<p>If we sell your assets, we will use the proceeds to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>your debt</li>
<li>any costs charged by the bailiff hired to sell the assets on our behalf</li>
</ul>
<p>You will still have to pay any remaining debt.</p>
</details>
	    <details><summary>What writs and memorials are</summary>
<p>
A <strong>writ</strong> is a written command or formal order in favour of the government. It is issued to tell an individual or a business to follow the directives given by the Federal Court. In some provinces, a writ is used to put a lien or charge against real property registered to a debtor.

A <strong>memorial</strong> is a document issued by the court. We ask for a memorial so we can put a charge or lien on property owned by a debtor.</p>
	    </details>
	    <h2 id="actions">Other legal collection actions we may take</h2>
		<p>Depending on your situation, there are different legal actions we might take.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="garnishing.html">Garnishing your income and accounts</a></li>
			<li><a href="co-liability.html">Making another person or entity also responsible for your debt</a></li>
		</ul>
