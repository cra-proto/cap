<p>You may have received a request from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to garnish a taxpayer’s income. It is important that you follow the instructions on the document. On this page, you will find more information about your responsibilities. </p>

<h2 id="toc1">What garnishments are: RTPs, ERTPs, and DTPs</h2>
<p>When we are unable to collect an amount owing or make an arrangement with the taxpayer to pay their debt, we may request funds from a third party. You may be identified as a third party if you owe (or will owe) money to a taxpayer. A third party could include a person or organization such as an employer or financial institution, or another source of income.</p>
<p>We send requests (called <strong>garnishments</strong>) as one of the following <strong>legal documents</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requirement to pay (RTP)</li>
  <li>Enhanced requirement to pay (ERTP)</li>
  <li>Demand on a third party (DTP)</li>
</ul>
<p>A garnishment tells you (a third party) that some or all money you normally pay to, or hold for someone who owes a debt to the government, is now payable to us or to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). </p>

  <li>Salary, wages, commissions, bonuses</li>
  <li>Money held at a financial institution</li>
  <li>Reimbursement of expenses owed to an employee</li>
  <li>Rent or lease payments</li>
  <li>Loans made by a corporation to a taxpayer, when the corporation is not dealing with the taxpayer at arm’s length (refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-5-transfer-income-property-rights-third-parties/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">Income Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length</a>)</li>

<h2 id="toc3">If you receive a garnishment</h2>
<p>You must comply when you receive a garnishment. The person or business who owes the debt cannot go after you  for the amounts you send us.</p>
<p>We send a copy of the garnishment to the person or business who owes the debt at the same time we send it to you. The amount you owe the taxpayer is reduced by the amount you send to us.</p>

<p><strong>Do not sell any assets</strong> such as houses, cars, jewellery, stocks, or bonds unless you have instructions to do so from the person or business who owes the debt or another person who has the authority to give instructions. The garnishment applies to the sale proceeds if the assets (such as the person’s house) are sold and converted into cash while it is in effect.</p>

  <p>If you receive a phone call from a trustee, continue to honour the garnishment request until you receive written confirmation of the insolvency filing.</p>
  <p>Call our contact number listed on the document before you take any action. In some instances, the money owed to the taxpayer belongs to the CRA or ESDC. If you distribute any money, you may become liable.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>If you plan to loan or advance money to an employee or to someone who you are not dealing with at arm’s length with, within 90 days from the date you receive the RTP or ERTP</summary>
  <p>You are required to send the money to us.

</details>
<h3 id="toc4">If you don't comply with a garnishment</h3>
<p>You become liable for the amount you did not pay to us, and we will take action to collect that amount from you.</p>
<p>You become liable if you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>do not pay us when you owe money to the person who owes the debt</li>
  <li>continue to pay the person amounts you are legally required to pay to us</li>
  <li>pay someone else on behalf of the person, such as a relative or another creditor instead of us</li>
  <li>•	loan or advance money to the person within 90 days from the date you receive the garnishment, if the specific term is included on the RTP</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc5">How much you must pay</h2>
<p>The first page of the garnishment shows the maximum amount you must withhold from the person and send to us. Send this amount to the CRA or ESDC for every payment you owe them <strong>unless</strong> the document instructs you to withhold one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A fixed amount from each payment</li>
  <li>A fixed amount from all amounts paid in a set time period, such as a month</li>
  <li>A percentage from each payment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Continue to withhold and send these amounts to us during the effective period of the garnishment request, or until the total you have sent equals the maximum amount requested.</p>
<p>In some cases, the garnishment may instruct you to send all amounts upon termination of employment.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>miscalculated your payments</strong> and paid more than you were required to pay, contact us at the number listed on the document.</p>
<h2 id="toc6">How to pay</h2>
<p>Payments may be payable to the CRA or ESDC. The garnishment will tell you who and where to send your payment. </p>
<p>Remember to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write the account number from the remittance form on the front of your cheque or money order</li>
  <li>Make your cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada</li>
  <li>Mail the remittance form, with your cheque or money order, to the address listed on the remittance form</li>
  <li>Keep a record of the amount and the date of your payment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you <strong>sent a payment and then received a withdrawal</strong> of the requirement to pay, contact us at the number provided on the notice.</p>
<h2 id="toc7">Validity period</h2>
<p>You will find the terms and effective period on the first page of the garnishment. Generally, it will be valid for one of the following time periods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>90 days</li>
  <li>One year</li>
  <li>The debt is paid in full</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Keep a copy of the garnishment for the entire period it is in effect and for at least one year after receiving it, as you may owe amounts to the person in the future.</p>
<p>Your obligation ends after one or more of the following situations happens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You no longer owe amounts to the person, and no other amounts become owing during the effective period of the garnishment</li>
  <li>You sent money to us totalling the maximum amount shown on the garnishment</li>
  <li>You receive a letter from us indicating the garnishment is no longer in effect</li>
  <li>The RTP or ERTP expires and is no longer valid</li>
</ul>
